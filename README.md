# Landing Pages Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing the implementation of landing page designs from Figma. The goal is to improve front-end development skills by converting design files into responsive, pixel-perfect web pages.

## Project Structure

Each landing page implementation is organized into its own folder. The structure typically includes:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Figma Design**: Select a Figma design to implement. You can use free designs from the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community).


## Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- Follow a mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Optimize images and assets for faster loading times.
- Use CSS variables or preprocessors (e.g., SASS) for maintainable styles.
